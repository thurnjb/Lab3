HIGH PRIORITY THINGS TO DO
scheduling process for move and auction (sql and code probably almost identical to "look at" ones)
inventory registration (I made some of the basics of the inventoryregistration.aspx page | wyatt currently working on sql) 
(i think inventory should have a FK of CustomerID so that from a customer page we could view 
their inventory items that are registered)
completetion page / close a ticket page (currently a very basic completetion page somewhere in the solution)
style all remaining pages, doesnt need to be perfect. we just cant have any default elements IMO

how i envision the workflows:
AUCTION
Customer page -> create auction 
-> inventory registration (fill out text boxes and hit 'add', allows you to fill out again for more items)
-> scheduling auction page (similar to schedule look-at process that jay created) -> ticket completion

MOVE
Customer page -> create move -> scheduling move page (similar to schedule look-at process that jay created)
-> ticket completion


15 min demo vid IDEAS (i think if were at least like 12mins were fine):
- login (maybe mention secuirty aspects of the login / accessing)
- view home page breifly
- add new customer
- go back home and show off searchbar feature, searching customers and showing that the new added customer will show up
- select the new customer that was added earlier 
- go to customer profile and maybe edit a detail
- create an move for the customer
- probably use populate button and dont spend too much time on each sceen because some of the boxes and stuff dont make much sense
- show off kestons navigation bar on the page as well
- confirm and start the scheduling sequence
- complete the scheduling sequence 
- select either the same or another existing customer
- create an auction
- populate and confirm
- register inventory items 
- complete auction scheduling process
- view customer inventory items from customer profite (if thats possible)
- complete ticket(s) (ticket completetion page)
- show calandar even if it doesnt work ?
Make sure you really highlight new additions from the previous sprint / additions the client
hasnt seen yet - ezell said thats important
